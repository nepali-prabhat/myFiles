# Chron's Disease

Chron's disease is an inflammatory bowls, autoimmune disease.

**Lupus**: 
  - long-term autoimmune disease
  
  - body's immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks normal healthy tissue
  
  - *in Chron's case, the immune system is attacking gastrointestinal tract*

**Bowls disease**
  - umbrella term
  - chronic inflamation of digestive tract

## Understanding the inflamation

During inflamation, the chemicals from our body's WBC enter our blood or tissues to protect our body from invaders.

This raises the blood flow level in that area causing redness and warmth. Some chemicals cause fluids to leak into our tissues resulting in swealing.

*Chronic inflamation* can cause our body to eventually attack healthy cell, tissues and organs.

## The high BPN

In many of the inflamatory bowls diseases, heart failure is of risk. The exact reasons for these increased risks are unclear, but inflammation may be a significant factor. The heart failure is indicated by extremely high BNP(Brain Natriuretic Peptide). 


## Understanding heart failure

Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the bodyâ€™s needs for blood and oxygen. In other words, *the heart can't keep up with the workload.*

The *heart* then tries to make up for this by:
  1. Enlarging
  2. Developing more muscle mass
  3. Pumping faster

The *body* also tries to make up for this by:
  1. Blood vessels become narrow
  2. Body tries to divert blood away from less important organs and tissues

Heart failure generally starts from left side first, affecting the left ventricle. Then right side failure occurs due to fluid pressure from lungs.

Besides these, pericarditis can also cause heart failure.
