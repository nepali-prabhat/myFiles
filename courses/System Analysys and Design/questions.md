The information system is very important for any organization for many different reasons. Some of the main reasons are listed below :-

Decision making: 
Information system provides tools for the management entity to make proper decisions for any kind of project. With the pool of information we can use the data insights to back and support the decision making process. For example a wine making company can decide where to open their next plant based on the users geographical demand provided by the information system.

Economic Importance:
Information system can cost a lot in the beginning but at the end the benefits provided by the system outweighs the initial cost. An organization can get the benefit of not having to manage large human resources on managing information on bills and papers. Computerized system requires few skilled manpower to operate the entire system.

Business Operations Management:
Information systems can offer more complete and more recent information, allowing you to operate your company more efficiently. We can use information systems to gain a cost advantage over competitors or to differentiate yourself by offering better customer service. Sales data give us insights about what customers are buying and let you stock or produce items that are selling well. 

Performance improvement:
With the information system digitized, the performance and speed of organization analytics and decision making skyrockets. It will help the teams to gather data, process and give meaningful insights with very less friction and effort. It increases productivity and resilience of the system.

2) Explain about a) Transaction processing system Transaction Processing System is a type of information processing system. In such a system each individual task is called a transaction. Each transaction is worked upon and executed by computer processors. It provides a quick real time response to the request. Such a system is also used to collect, store, retrieve and modify transactions executed by an organization.
b) Decision support system Decision support system is a digital system that analyzes data and gives meaningful insights that supports the decision making process in an organization. It is fed a lot of data to process and analyze. Such systems are precise and can be tailored to fit organization specific goals. Nowadays decision support systems include Machine Learning to not only support the decision but predict outcomes in the foreseeable future based on the training data it is provided.
